                    shooting victims for variables such as sex or race of the victim compare to the demographic breakdowns of those variables within the boroughs 
                    where they occurred to see if they are proportional. The datasets for this research were chosen as a result of their volume, with the merged 
                    dataset containing over fifty unique variables and 21,400 observations. Another factor was the cleanliness of the data; little to no cleaning
